![Iris Flowers](iris.jpg)

## Overview

This project aims to classify Iris flower species using the Decision Tree algorithm. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning, making it an excellent choice for learning and practicing classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
