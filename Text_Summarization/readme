# Document Summarization App using Language Model

This is a Streamlit-based web application for document summarization using a pre-trained language model. The application takes a PDF file as input, processes it, and generates a summary using a language model. The generated summary and the original document are then displayed side by side.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/document-summarization-app.git

2. Run the following command in the terminal:
   cd document-summarization-app
   pip install streamlit langchain transformers
    ```
3. Run the following command in the terminal:
   streamlit run app.py

Usage
Upload your PDF file by clicking the "Upload your PDF file" button.

Click the "Summarize" button to generate a summary of the uploaded PDF document.

The original document and the generated summary will be displayed side by side.

How It Works
The application uses the following libraries and components:

Streamlit: The Python web application framework for building the user interface.
langchain: A library for working with text data, including PDF loading and text splitting.
transformers: Hugging Face's Transformers library, used for loading a pre-trained language model for summarization.
PyPDFLoader: A component from langchain for loading PDF documents.
T5Tokenizer and T5ForConditionalGeneration: Components from the transformers library for tokenization and language model loading.
The language model is loaded and used to generate a summary of the uploaded PDF document. The generated summary is displayed alongside the original document for comparison.
