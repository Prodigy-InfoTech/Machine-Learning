# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview


Step into the world of Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning. This is your guide to understanding how we employ smart algorithms and data analysis to keep your finances secure. We'll explore the nuts and bolts of our approach, making sure you're well-equipped to grasp the ins and outs of this crucial defense system. This project include

- **CreditCard.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the Machine learning model. You can explore the code, run cells, and see how the model is trained and evaluated.

- **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the code in the Jupyter Notebook. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- **CreditCardData.csv**: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model. Make sure to review the dataset and understand its structure before running the notebook.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Spam Email Classification project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Rc17git/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/credit-card-fraud
    cd Credit Card Fraud Detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```
    jupyter notebook CreditCard.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

## Dataset

The dataset (`CreditCard.csv`) contains labeled examples of transactions, indicating whether they are fraud or not. It is essential to understand the dataset structure to interpret the model's results accurately.

## Model Evaluation

The machine learning model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation results are presented in the notebook, providing insights into the model's performance.


Happy coding!
